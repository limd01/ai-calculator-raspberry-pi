# AI Calculator (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W)

This is a personal hardware + AI project where I am building a handheld AI-powered calculator using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, camera module, and touchscreen.

The goal is to create a device that can:
- Capture math or science problems using a camera
- Convert the image into text (OCR)
- Generate step-by-step explanations using an AI model
- Display the solution on a small touchscreen

## Why I’m building this
I’m interested in combining software and hardware, especially embedded systems and AI interfaces. This project helps me learn how real devices integrate:
- Python scripting
- Raspberry Pi hardware setup
- Computer vision (camera + OCR)
- API integration with AI models
- Simple UI development

I started this project independently to explore building physical computing systems beyond coursework.

## Current Progress
- Parts acquired (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, camera, touchscreen)
- Setting up Raspberry Pi OS (waiting on USB SD card reader)
- Next steps: boot testing → camera testing → OCR → AI integration

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Raspberry Pi Camera Rev 1.3
- Waveshare 2.8" DSI LCD Touchscreen
- microSD storage
- DSI + camera ribbon cables

## Status
Work in progress. This repository documents the build and development process.

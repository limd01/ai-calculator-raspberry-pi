This is a personal hardware + AI project where I am building a handheld AI-powered calculator using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, camera module, and touchscreen.

The goal is to create a device that can capture math or science problems and generate step-by-step explanations using AI.

## Planned Features

- Capture math or science problems using a camera
- Convert images into text (OCR)
- Generate step-by-step solutions using AI models
- Display results on a small touchscreen
  
## Why I'm building this

I'm interested in combining embedded systems with AI.  
This project helps me learn how hardware and software integrate in real-world devices.

Focus areas:
- Raspberry Pi hardware setup
- Python scripting
- Computer vision (camera + OCR)
- AI API integration
  
  ## Hardware Used

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module v1.3
- 2.8" DSI Touchscreen (480x640)
- MicroSD card (Raspberry Pi OS)
  
## Project Status

Currently in early development.

Completed:
- Hardware parts acquired
- Initial repository setup
- Basic software structure

Next steps:
- Boot Raspberry Pi OS
- Camera capture script
- OCR integration
- AI response pipeline
